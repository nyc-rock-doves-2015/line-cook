# Line-Cook
Line-cook is a cooking-helper app for iOS that utilizes iPhone's speech-synthesis/speech-recognition to allow users to cook while their device reads recipe steps aloud to them. You can get the best sense for how it works by watching this [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRDpgN5HK8&feature=youtu.be). 

## Core Functionalities
1. Search for recipes via the [BigOven](http://api.bigoven.com/documentation "BigOven Documentation") API
2. Choose a recipe from search results
3. View recipe ingredients and steps and issue [voice commands](https://github.com/nyc-rock-doves-2015/line-cook/tree/readme_final)
4. Create an account to save favorite recipes

## Voice Commands
 Command        | Result
| ------------- |-------------------------------|
| Start         | Begins recipe recitation      |
| Next          | Reads off next step in recipe |
| Repeat        | Repeats current step in recipe|
| Quit          | Disables listener             |
